🧹 Data Cleaning Using MySQL
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing using MySQL. The dataset used is the world_layoffs dataset, which contains real-world data about company layoffs across different countries and industries.

The main goal of this project is to transform raw, inconsistent data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset.

🧠 Objectives

Remove duplicate records

Standardize inconsistent data (such as company names, industries, and locations)

Handle and fill null or missing values

Drop unnecessary or irrelevant columns

Prepare the cleaned dataset for data analysis and visualization

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Language: SQL

Database: MySQL

Dataset: world_layoffs.csv

🧩 Key Steps

Data Import: Load the world_layoffs dataset into MySQL.

Duplicate Removal: Identify and delete duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

Data Standardization: Clean inconsistent naming formats and data types.

Null Handling: Replace or remove missing values based on relevance.

Column Cleaning: Drop unused or irrelevant columns to optimize the dataset.

Final Validation: Verify data consistency and completeness after cleaning.

📊 Outcome

A cleaned version of the world_layoffs dataset ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) or business insights generation.

💡 Future Work

Visualize layoff trends using Power BI or Tableau

Analyze layoff patterns by country, industry, and time period

Automate cleaning steps using Python scripts
